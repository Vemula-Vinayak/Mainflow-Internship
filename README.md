# Mainflow Internship — Data Analytics & Reporting

## Overview
This repository contains my internship deliverables and analysis work completed during the Mainflow internship. The focus of the work includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), insights generation, and healthcare-related analytics using datasets such as heart disease and heart failure.

## What’s Included
- Internship task reports (PDF deliverables)
- Healthcare analytics reports (Heart Disease / Heart Failure)
- Findings and summaries from analysis work

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Data exploration and data quality checks
- Insight generation and reporting
- Analytical thinking and structured documentation
- Basic machine learning concepts (where applicable)

## Repository Structure (Recommended)

## Highlights
- Created structured deliverables for multiple internship tasks
- Documented insights from healthcare datasets to support decision-making
- Practiced end-to-end analysis workflow: problem understanding → analysis → reporting

## Next Improvements (Planned)
- Add a Jupyter Notebook (`notebooks/`) showing the analysis workflow (EDA + model training)
- Add a `requirements.txt` for reproducibility
- Add charts/screenshots to make insights easier to scan
